MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

* Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 7.11.   

* If the MCR is not installed, run MCRInstaller, located in:

  
  /export/home/system/software/redqueen/matlab/R2009b/toolbox/compiler/deploy/glnxa64/MCRInstaller.bin

For more information on the MCR Installer, see the MATLAB Compiler 
documentation.    



2. Files to Deploy and Package

Files to package for Shared Libraries
=====================================
-mmath.ctf (component technology file) 
-mmath.so
-mmath.h
-MCRInstaller.bin 
   - include when building component by selecting "include MCR" option
-This read-me file

3. Definitions

MCR - MATLAB Compiler uses the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR), 
which is a standalone set of shared libraries that enable the execution 
of M-files. The MCR provides complete support for all features of 
MATLAB without the MATLAB GUI. When you package and distribute an 
application to users, you include supporting files generated by the 
builder as well as the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). If necessary, 
run MCRInstaller to install the correct version of the MCR. For more 
information about the MCR, see the MATLAB Compiler documentation.

Component Technology File (CTF) - Archive of encrypted MATLAB files that 
mmath uses for successful execution of exported M functions. 


4. Appendix 

A. On the target machine, add the MCR directory to the system path    
   specified by the target system's environment variable. 


    i. Locate the name of the environment variable to set, using the  
       table below:

    Operating System        Environment Variable
    ================        ====================
    Linux                   LD_LIBRARY_PATH


     ii. Set the path by doing one of the following:

        NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed
              on the target machine.         


        * Add the MCR directory to the environment variable by issuing 
          the following commands:

            setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                <mcr_root>/v711/runtime/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v711/sys/os/glnxa64:
                <mcr_root>/v711/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/native_threads:
                <mcr_root>/v711/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64/server:
                <mcr_root>/v711/sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/amd64 
            setenv XAPPLRESDIR <mcr_root>/v711/X11/app-defaults


        NOTE: To make these changes persistent after logout on UNIX or 
              Mac machines, modify the .cshrc file to include this  
              setenv command.
        NOTE: on UNIX or Mac, the environment variable syntax utilizes   
              forward slashes (/), delimited by colons (:).
